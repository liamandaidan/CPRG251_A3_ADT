This program creates a linked list of users and functions are created to modify 
the linked list and is then serialized and stored as a binary file. A series of 
tests are performed to ensure the functionalities are working correctly. 

The SLL class implements the LinkedListADT interface and
handles any exceptions presented in the code. There is also Node class class that
represents a node in the linked list. 

The SLL class contains the following functions to modify a linked list: 
	1. prepend an item to the linked list
	2. append an item  to the linked list 
	3. insert an item to the linked list 
	4. replace an item in the linked list 
	5. retrieve an item at a specific index
	6. get the index of a specific item
	7. check if the linked list has a specific item
	8. clear the linked list 
	9. get the number of items in the linked list 
	10. remove an item from the linked list 
	

How to run the tests: 

In the test folder > tests
	- to test the linked list functionalities select the LinkedListADT.java file > 'Run as JUnit Test'
	- to test the serialization tests functionalities select the Serialization.java file > 'Run as JUnit Test'
